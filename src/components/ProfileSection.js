              Recently I read a book by Jeffrey Fischer,{" "}
              <em>The Next Conversation: Argue Less, Learn More.</em> <br></br>{" "}
              In it, he encourages people to reflect on their personal
              values—three guiding principles that shape who you are. <br></br>
              <br></br> His was inspiring:<br></br>
              1. Where there is room for kindness, I will use it. <br></br> 2.
              Tell them who I am without saying a word.<br></br> 3. If I can’t
              be a bridge, I’ll be a lighthouse.<br></br>
              <br></br>You might think, “What an unusual way to start a resume.”
              But as a 44-year-old who has lived in Asia, Europe, Great Britain,
              and Africa, and worked across a variety of industries, I’ve come
              to realize that a job is more than just skills—it’s about how you
              fit within a company’s culture. Skills can always be learnt, but
              values and personality define how we connect with others. That’s
              why I created this site: to share not just my projects, but also a
              glimpse of who I am. These projects are my first steps into
              full-stack program development. They reflect both my learning
              journey and my personality—things I’m passionate about, designed
              in my own style. Alongside coding, I bring experience in logistics
              and graphic design, giving me a unique perspective that blends
              structure with creativity. <br></br>
              <br></br>I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed
              creating it.
